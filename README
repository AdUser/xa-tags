===== Build =====

Build process is simple:

cd <root of source tree>
cmake <options> .
make
make test    # optional
make install # optional, not works yet

You may change cmake options either by specifying it manually as cmake args, or by ccmake, ncurses util, usially shipped with cmake. A few axamples:

  cmake -DOPT_UUID64=ON -DOPT_WITHOUT_GETTEXT=ON .

  ccmake .
  <change anything>
  cmake .

Each option begins with "OPT_" prefix. Complete list of available options you may asquire by folloving command:

  grep OPTION CMakeLists.txt
