OVERVIEW
========

xa-tags is the util, allows you to store and manage sets of custom tags
associated with file.

Designed and written with eye on high portability, small resource consumption
and minimum dependencies. In fact, this software can even run on your router.

MODES
=====

Two operational modes planned: standalone tool and client-server.

Standalone modes:
  * TOOL - embedded version requires only xattr support on your fs, stores
           all data inside inodes.
         - full version requires sqlite3 also (for now). Stores tags in database
           and files' id in inodes. Not suffer from inode size limitation.
           Allow you search against full list of uniq tags, used in database.

See 'INSTALL' file and 'doc/' directory for more details.
