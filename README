xa-tags is the util, allows you to store and manage sets of custom tags associated with file.

Designed and written with eye on high portability, small resource consumption and minimum dependencies. In fact, this software can even run on your router.

Four operational modes planned: two as standalone tool and two as client-server.

Standalone modes:
  * DUMB_TOOL     - requires only xattr support on your fs, stores all data inside inodes.
  * SMART_TOOL    - requires sqlite also. Stores tags in database and files' id in inodes.
                    Not suffer from inode size limitation.

See 'INSTALL' file and 'doc/' directory for more details.
