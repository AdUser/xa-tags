===== Build =====

Build process is simple:

cd <root of source tree>
cmake <options> .
make
make test    # optional
make install # optional, not works yet

You may change cmake options either by specifying it manually as cmake args, or by ccmake, ncurses util, usially shipped with cmake. A few axamples:

  cmake -DOPT_WITHOUT_GETTEXT=ON .

  ccmake .
  <change anything>
  cmake .

Each option begins with "OPT_" prefix. Complete list of available options you may asquire by folloving command:

  grep OPTION CMakeLists.txt

===== Theory =====
Amount of data, that you can store in xattr is very limited on most common linux fs.

On ext* FS family it directly depends on used block size of filesystem. You can't change this after formating your disk, so take care about it in advance.

On JFS amount of data limited by 64k per file.

On XFS and ReiserFS there is no practical limit for size, but, you should remember, that it consumes precious space, reserved for inodes.

Note, that this space also shared with acl's, security labels (Selinux, for example) or maybe other programs. So, available size for data may be greatly smaller, than you expect.

For more detail information see manual page attr(5).

Basically, to get everything works, make sure in following:

  - you have enabled support for xattr in kernel for choosen filesystem
    zgrep XATTR /proc/config.gz
  - your filesystem mounted with user_xattr option (for ext* or reiserfs)

===== Identifier generation rules =====

UUID of each file is a some random number. It is used in any mode other than "dumb_tool". Values of identifier is between 1 and 2^64. By printable form, identifier should be hex-encoded and padded to 16 chars.
